                     Rune Ragnarok's Lead Developer approached me to develop an interactive and smooth front-end 
                     experience for their up and coming game, Rune Ragnarok. I was immediately 
                     interested in transforming the unique feel I got from the game to a website. 
                     With the company putting their full trust on me for creative decisions, I decided to go all 
                     out.

                  <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4-desktop">Human Head Studios announced that Rune Ragnarok was under development. 
                     in August 2017, their website was only a landing page with the game's logo and 3 buttons. Needless to say it wasn't much of a hit.
                     I got straight into work and started gathering information from the dev team and competitors in the same genre of the game.
                     Providing planned design and responsive front-end templates that I integrated into WordPress with
                     content management system and custom apis to retrieve data and push data to their game servers. 
                     My position might be UI/UX on paper, but I was full-stack and I loved it.</h2>

                  <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4-desktop"> The goal of the whole re-modeling of the website was to 
                     increase users subscription to the mailing list and user interaction with the game. 
                     Through communication with the marketing department of the team, we created few marketing 
                     campaigns to keep the user engaged with the game's development. Various competitions, 
                     quizzes and social media accounts were created.

                  <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4-desktop">Once the new conversion flow was designed and prototyped, 
                     I created discussions groups and conducted moderated user testings,
                     Through data analysis, improvements were made and increased subscription rate up to 40%. 
                     I then added new features to keep user engagement such as a forum and a blog system.</h2>

                     of many other projects; I gave an estimate and time-scale for design and development and got 
                     the project live. Every once in a while, the dev team would return to me with additional tasks 
                     or new problems that needed solving and we'd work together on a solution. </h2>

                     Analysing user behaviour was an important part of the improving of Rune Ragnarok's website. Tools such as Google 
                     Analytics and VWO gave insights into users so we could learn about how they behave 
                     and interact with the website.
